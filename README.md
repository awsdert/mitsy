# Mitsy
MIT licensed C compiler

The name mitsy is derived from combining "MIT" from "MIT License" and "C" from "C Programming Language" to form "MITC" then morphing it to a more readable name based on how it sounds when pronounced.

Currently this is just a recently started hobby project so don't expect much any time soon, anyways my eventual goals for this project are below.

# Current Targets
1. Convert local text encoding to UTF-8 for all internal functions to use
2. Read various literals correctly
3. Precompile a file
4. Produce a working elf that just returns 0
5. Produce a working elf that prints "Hello World!" via libc's puts()
6. Produce a working elf from code alone
7. Enable user to code simple functions for precompiler
8. Port ALL of assembly creation to header file for precompiler to include internally (will start with AMD64)
9. Compile various projects relying on GCC extensions
10. Compile linux kernel
11. Compile variours projects relying on MSC extensions
12. Compile ReactOS kernal
13. Do all that as a portable compiler
14. Add more assembly creation headers
15. Make compiler a shared library to plug into future apps
15. Think of new targets :)
