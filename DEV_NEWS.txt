Found this project had been starred by someone
so as a means of giving updates on what I'm (and
later other devlopers) doing at least I created
this file.

========
Now: Worked out how to process the exponent
in a float, now looking for corner cases
**Task list after the above is done (within current goal)
1. Check same logic works for double and long double
2. Introduce logic for alternative bases between 2
and 62
3. Transfer logic into a function for mitsy, the function
will handle converting numbers of any base for both
numeric literals and after the base is already decided
e.g both 0x30 and \x30 should result in UTF-8 '0'.
