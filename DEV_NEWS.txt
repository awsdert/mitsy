Found this project had been starred by someone
so as a means of giving updates on what I'm (and
later other devlopers) doing at least I created
this file.

========
Now: Seemed to have correctly handled exponent and rounding, currently trying to find where an infinite loop is occuring
**Task list after the above is done (within current goal)
1. Check same logic works for double and
long double ~ quirks in large exponents
2. Introduce logic for alternative bases between 2
and 62 ~ tested on both decimal and hexadecimal
3. Transfer logic into a function for mitsy, the function
will handle converting numbers of any base for both
numeric literals and after the base is already decided
e.g both 0x30 and \x30 should result in UTF-8 '0'. ~ prepping
unit_tests.c for this
