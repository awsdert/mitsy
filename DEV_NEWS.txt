Found this project had been starred by someone
so as a means of giving updates on what I'm (and
later other devlopers) doing at least I created
this file.

========
Now: creating a little cheat utility for Final Fantasy XV while keeping
the API as close to fexible as possible so that I can use on other games
(Got tired of waiting for PINCE to be usable and for GameConqueror to
ever be updated) - will help me with later target because I have to
duplicate aset of callback functions to pass to glut to make the lua
calls match the window they're intended for, consult this address for info

When I come back: Seemed to have correctly handled exponent and rounding,
currently trying to find where an infinite loop is occuring - don't
remember if I've done this, can always try compiling the test file which
hooks the API and tries it, might be at the point where I'm redesigning
what I had to be more memory effiecient and take less parameters since
that was definitly not the intended final function, still gotta do the
math functions however and even decode back to a string
**Task list after the above is done (within current goal)
1. Check same logic works for double and
long double ~ quirks in large exponents
2. Introduce logic for alternative bases between 2
and 62 ~ tested on both decimal and hexadecimal
3. Transfer logic into a function for mitsy, the function
will handle converting numbers of any base for both
numeric literals and after the base is already decided
e.g both 0x30 and \x30 should result in UTF-8 '0'. ~ prepping
unit_tests.c for this
